A Terms & Conditions document 
for a website is an agreement 
the website makes with its 
users about how to use the 
application properly, as well 
as the obligations and 
responsibilities of each 
party. Apps, especially 
commercial apps, have a portion 
of the site devoted to 
Terms & Conditions because 
it's the most important 
document for letting app users
know what is expected of them.

One of the primary functions of 
a Terms & Conditions document is 
to outline what will happen in 
a variety of different possible
situations, including if the user 
breaks the rules and must have 
his/her account terminated. 
If the user goes in knowing 
what to expect, it is less 
likely that there will be 
problems between the user and 
the app down the road.

The Terms & Conditions document 
on any app creates a legally 
binding set of rules for the user, 
as well as, in most cases, 
the app owner. It's a place to 
set up expectations for each 
of the parties and ensure that 
the use of the app runs smoothly 
for both.
